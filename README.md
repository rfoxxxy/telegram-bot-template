# rf0x3d's telegram bot template
not so slight, but really fast

### mainly used libraries:
* aiogram - heart of a bot
* sqlalchemy w/ asyncpg & aiosqlite - memory of a bot
* apscheduler - task scheduler of a bot
* loguru - mouth of a bot

### features:
* automatic module loader - modular system has always been the most convenient to develop
* core tasks - code that can be executed on startup (for example, web server)
* scheduler tasks - apscheduler wrapper
* improved keyboards module - slight, fast, extended
* important utils and middlewares out of the box
